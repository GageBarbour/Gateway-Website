                        rooms we rent out. We are able to rent out single rooms, clear up to the whole house. Rates
                        include all bills, cable, and high-speed internet. Best part with all of this, there is no
                        hassle with long term contracts!</p>

                    <p>Every room includes a cable jack, and fully furnished bedroom set. Each floor has its own
                        kitchen and its own separate entrance. There is also a washer and dryer<strong>*</strong> on
                        the premises, with a few exceptions. We also have connections with a local cleaning service

                        30%! This decrease on rent is one of the many ways we save companies on lodging.</p>

                    <small><strong>*</strong> The washer and dryer are only available when the entire first floor isn't
                        rented out to
